We, a party of six, stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed every moment of it. The cottages are ethnic, but very spacious and provided with all amenities. Every thing was spotlessly clean and after the pandemic induced forced quarantine, we got a new lease of life. The resort has extensive garden and number of water bodies."
